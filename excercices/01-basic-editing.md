# Basic text editing

There's a word in the jumbled.txt file (original curtesy of http://www.network-science.de/ascii/).
Recompose it by re-ordering on line numbers

Steps - reset to jumbled version between each step
1. Free-form: Recompose message using any method (move lines, cut/paste via menu or shortcut)
2. Is there a menu / shortcut to do the same in less clicks/key strokes
3. Rinse/Repeat step 2 until you cannot find any improvement. Bonus if both hands stay on the keyboard!
   What's the smallest number of actions you got to?
4. Practice your optimum method a few times.
   Can you notice any speed improvement?
