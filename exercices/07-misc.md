# Miscellaneous

Here's a (somewhat random) selection I discovered recently, for IntelliJ:
* Close the current tab: Ctrl+F4
* Search anywhere: double shift

1. What's the equivalent for your chosen IDE, if it exists?
1. What features from your IDE haven't we touched on yet?
1. Go hunt for a feature that looks interesting and share with your neighbours / the group

List raised during the workshop:
* Ctrl + Alt + left / right: extend selection (Resharper)
* Home / End (!)
* Ctrl + [ Shift + ] left/right
* Ctrl + Home / End
* Alt + PgUp / PgDwn (Resharper)
* Ctrl + Shift + R (Resharper)
* Alt + Enter (IntelliJ)
