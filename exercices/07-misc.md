# Miscellaneous

Here's a (somewhat random) selection I discovered recently, for IntelliJ:
* Close the current tab: Shift+click
* Search anywhere: double shift

1. What's the equivalent for your chosen IDE, if it exists?
1. What features from your IDE haven't we touched on yet?
1. Go hunt for a feature that looks interesting and share with your neighbourgs / the group
