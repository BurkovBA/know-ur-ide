# Know Your Tools - IDE

This project contains supporting documents for a "Know your Tools" workshop, focused on the IDE. 

The idea of the workshop came from the principle that good crafters know their tools well. I noticed I wasn't making 
good use of the various features and shortcuts of my IDE (IntelliJ) and thought investing the time to learn them would be 
beneficial.

The various exercices are here to help you discover features of your existing IDE, or might be useful if you've recently 
switched to a new one to start exploring. It starts with some exercises covering basic text editing, then move to some 
refactoring. 
You are encouraged to follow a "hands on keyboard" rule to go further and forgo the mouse/trackpad entirely to start building 
muscle memory for those time saving shortcuts....

The suggested refactoring is based on the code from "legacy code retreat", which you can find here: 
https://github.com/jbrains/trivia . It covers a variety of languages. I recommend picking one which you're already familiar 
with. 
However, if there's another codebase you're familiar with, there are probably relevant examples too!

Ingredients needed on your machine before you start going into the exercises:
* IDE / Text Editor of choice
* "legacy code retreat" project for your chosen language
* a local version control will help (we'll be doing some change, reset, repeat cycles)
